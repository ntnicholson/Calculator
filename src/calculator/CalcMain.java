/*
 * Project objective: As a developer, write a program to create an arithmetic calculator.
 * 
 * Background of the problem statement:
 * 
 * As a developer, write a Java code to create a calculator to perform the four
 * basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and
 * division).
 * 
 * You must use the following:
 * 
 * Eclipse/IntelliJ: An IDE to code for the application Java: A programming language 
 * Git: To connect and push files from the local system to GitHub
 * GitHub: To store the application code and track its versions 
 * Core Java concepts: Variables, data types, operators, type casting, control statements,
 * class, objects, access specifiers, and core keywords like final, this, and
 * static
 * 
 * Following requirements should be met:
 * The versions of the code should be tracked on GitHub repositories. The
 * calculator should work properly.
